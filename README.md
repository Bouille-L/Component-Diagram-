# Nasdaq-100_front_end
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a web application that provides users with comprehensive information and interactive charts for Nasdaq-100 ETF (TQQQ, QQQ, SQQQ). The application will empower users to make informed investment decisions and track ETF performance.

The project includes the development of a user-friendly web application that aggregates and displays real-time data, interactive charts, news, and educational content related to Nasdaq-100 ETFs (TQQQ, QQQ, NASDAQ-100, SQQQ).
Exclusions: The project does not cover the development of a mobile application or trading functionality.

Such an application can provide significant value to investors, traders, and anyone interested in the Nasdaq-100 index and its constituent ETFs (TQQQ, QQQ, NASDAQ-100, SQQQ).  It can help users make informed investment decisions and track the performance of these ETFs. While there are existing financial data platforms, creating a new, user-friendly, and innovative interface that specifically focuses on Nasdaq-100 ETFs can offer a unique perspective and features, setting it apart from generic financial websites.
                                                                                           
                                                                   
                                                                                      
## Architectural Principles and Approach:
Design Philosophy: The architecture is crafted with an emphasis on modularity, scalability, and responsiveness, aiming to deliver a smooth user experience when accessing financial data.

Architectural Style: The application embraces a client-server model, ensuring a distinct separation between the backend (utilizing Django REST) and the frontend (powered by ReactJS).
Frameworks and Technologies:
- Django REST Framework: Selected for its effectiveness and robustness in managing RESTful API services, which are essential for delivering real-time financial data.
- ReactJS: Chosen for the frontend development to facilitate a dynamic and interactive user interface. Its component-based structure enables efficient updates and the rendering of dynamic elements, such as charts and news feeds.
- Chart.js: Employed to provide interactive and responsive chart visualizations, significantly enhancing the data presentation capabilities of the application.

High-Level Structure: The backend is tasked with handling API calls, data processing, and storage operations (such as archiving user messages). The frontend is designed to effectively display data through both static and dynamic components.
